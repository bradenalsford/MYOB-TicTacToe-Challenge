## Rules

To win Tic Tac Toe, one player must successfully get 3 of their respective tokens in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row. Players take turns at "placing" a token on the board. To place a token, the coordinates should be entered in the following format - row,col. eg. 1,3 will place a token in the first row in the final column, if the space is available. If the board completely fills and neither player has 3 tokens in a row, the game is a draw.

Player 1's tokens are `X`'s and Player 2's are `O`'s.

You may enter `q` at any time to exit the game.
